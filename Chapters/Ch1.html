        <h2 id="A">Precursors</h2>
            <p>Before the subway lines we have today, NYC had other forms of rail/tunnel based transport, including trams, cable cars, and more. Some infrastructure is still visible today, but a lot of it has been torn down. I'll go in depth on a few specific ones.</p>
        <h3>Streetcars and Cable Cars</h3>
            <p>Many streetcars and cable cars operated in the city before the subways came. Almost none remain.</p>

        <h3>Early Elevated Lines</h3>
            <p>Before the "modern" subways we have today, private elevated lines ran in NYC. They're like the trains we have today, but older(will go into more detail later). These "Els" were operated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Railway_Company" target="_blank">Manhattan Railway Company</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Rapid_Transit_Company" target="_blank">Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company</a>. These Els were built around the late 1800s, and helped move many people across the city. They were originally powered by wooden cars and steam engines, but were converted to electrified by the beginning of the 1900s.

            <p>Map of all NYC Elevated lines, including the old ones(the modern ones are also included, you may recognize some of them from our system)</p>
            <p>Note: These lines are ELEVATED, meaning they run above ground, unlike the underground subways we have today. Many of the lines shown in the map, especially in manhattan, no longer exist(I'll go more in depth on that later).</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Early Tunnels</h3>
            <p>Just wanted to give a shout out to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Pneumatic_Transit" target="_blank">Beach Pneumatic Transit</a> system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobble_Hill_Tunnel" target="_blank">Cobble Hill Tunnel</a>. These were some of the first tunnels built in NYC, built in the 1800s, and were used to test the feasibility of underground rail transport. The Beach Pneumatic Transit was a short-lived pneumatic subway that ran under Broadway, and the Cobble Hill Tunnel was a tunnel built for the Long Island Rail Road, but was never used for that purpose. There's whole stories behind these, but I'll save that for another time.

                <h3>The First Subway</h3>
                <p>
                    The definition of a subway is an "an underground electric railroad." And prior to 1904, NYC had no such system. Planning started around 1890s, with funds allocated, the route planned out, and more. The first contract, Contract 1, was signed on February 21, 1900. The first part of the route opened on <em>October 27, 1904</em> and ran from City Hall to 145th street, and was operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company(IRT).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This line is still in use today, as the Lexingtone Avenue Line(456 trains, green line) from Brooklyn Bridge(The original city hall station was closed) to Grand Central 42nd, the shuttle from Grand Central to Times Square, and the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line(123 trains, red line) from Times Square 42nd to 145th Street.

                <h3>Expansion</h3>
                <p>
                    NYC continued expanding its system for a few decades, with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company(BRT, later the BMT) joining the IRT in operating the new subway lines. It gets pretty complicated here, but I'll just go over some major events.

                <h3>The Dual Contracts</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dual Contracts, signed in 1913, greatly expanded the subway system, and led to the construction of many of the lines we know today, operated by the IRT and BRT.

                <h3>The IND</h3>
                <p>
                    The Independent Subway System(IND) was spearheaded by Mayor John Hylan(funny story behind this guy, he was fired from his post as a BRT motorman, and hated the private companies, advocating for a publicly operated system, the IND) and built in the 1930s. It was operated by the city, unlike the IRT and BMT, which were privately operated. The IND first system was built, but a second system for expansion was proposed and never built, due to this city having those money issues again.

            <h2 id="C">Unification, the MTA</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Bankrupcy and Unification</h3>
                <p>
                    The IRT and BMT became bankrupt, so they were bought out by the NYC Board of Transportation(The IND's operator) in 1940. The city took over the private companies, and the system was operated by the city. The system was renamed the New York City Transit System in 1953, and the New York City Transit Authority in 1953. The system was renamed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority(MTA) in 1968, and the MTA still operates the system today.
                    <br>
                    Because of unification, many redundancies in the system were removed, such as the old elevated lines. Not much expansion has happened since.
