        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I'm making this thing to practice html but also to I guess train u on trains, since that's pretty cool and all. And as the warning says, if u don't memorize this, u will get twists. 
            <br>Anywayss, here is my edition of all the information u need to know on trains in order to satify my requirements. I'll put a couple chapters for u to review, maybe add a quiz or something, since I started learning forms(not finished yet tho). I expect u to memorize eeverythiing in here :)</p>
